### Some project resources 

* Do a literature study of some topic or question. Parse at least 3 papers (perhaps a recent one, an early one, and a most highly cited one), and triangulate among these to come to your own view. Forward and backward citations can be studied in [Web of Science](http://apps.webofknowledge.com.access.library.miami.edu) or [Scopus](https://www-scopus-com.access.library.miami.edu) through [the UM library](https://www.library.miami.edu). For annotating papers online, I like [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is).

* [Mapes IDV collection - browse it](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=115a4ff0-10de-4fba-86d7-66cd42d6d8de)

* [New: trajectories in IDV](https://ams.confex.com/ams/98Annual/webprogram/Paper337280.html) see [3-mintue YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0DwH--5GP8)

* Find a Wikipedia page (or lack of one) you might want to [train to edit](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/University_of_Miami/Weather_Analysis_(Fall_2019)?enroll=fjsbeacg)

* Do something dynamical with a Jupyter/Python toy model like [these](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM663_convection_meso/tree/master/Resources/Notebooks) or [these]()

* Case study of a [weather in MERRA2](https://fluid.nccs.nasa.gov/reanalysis/classic_merra2/?one_click=1&tau=15&stream=MERRA2&level=0&region=usa&fcst=19930313&field=ptype), right down to [obs assimilation aspects](http://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=8f4d8443-54ed-419b-a74b-fb0c6ace4daf) if it is in the available time window. 

* Othe aspects of MERRA2, inclusing aerosols or so many other things: see all the collections and my instructions on how to open them in IDV or Panoply [here](https://hyp.is/NuATNvQBEemtxQPBlKyywQ/gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pubs/docs/Bosilovich785.pdf).

* Case study of a climate timescale "event" with monthly mean fields and/or budgets from MERRA2.

* Do a computation with a [shallow water equations solver notebook](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/blob/master/Notebooks/SWEmodel.ipynb)

  * for instance, on downstream development and Rossby wave dispersion (8.33 of Wallace and Hobbs, LMT exercise 1.5, make your own [time-longitude plots from data](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/map/time_plot/)

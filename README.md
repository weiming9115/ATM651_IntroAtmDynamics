### Some project resources 

* [Mapes IDV collection - browse it](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=115a4ff0-10de-4fba-86d7-66cd42d6d8de)

* [New: trajectories in IDV](https://ams.confex.com/ams/98Annual/webprogram/Paper337280.html) see [3-mintue YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0DwH--5GP8)

* Find a Wikipedia page (or lack of one) you might want to [train to edit](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/University_of_Miami/Weather_Analysis_(Fall_2019)?enroll=fjsbeacg)

* Do something dynamical with a Jupyter/Python toy model like [these](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM663_convection_meso/tree/master/Resources/Notebooks) or [these]()

* Case study of a weather event, right down to [assimilation aspects](http://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=8f4d8443-54ed-419b-a74b-fb0c6ace4daf), perhaps a "case" of large MERRA2 Analysis Tendency (where model tendencies failed to explain the observed evolution).

* Case study of a climate "event," with monthly mean budgets from MERRA2

| Unit 1 | Monday  | Wednesday  |
|---|------------- | ------------- |
| First week| Intro/welcome | Math review  |
| 2| Assign HW0; review SI units & physics basics | Go over any [HW0](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/tree/master/Unit1-Terminology_and_Tools) questions; survey Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 Q & A |
| 3 | LABOR DAY- NO CLASS | Any last HW0 questions? Collect it. Intro to [Ju-Py-Github](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/presentations/ProfGrumpy_guide_condaJuPyGitHub.pptx.pdf), installation assignment|
| 4 | Tsai - return HW0, discuss. Computer install clinic; Jupyter demo & first .ipynb assignment (kinematics) | **Reviewed student kinematic .ipynb's**, began on WH Ch7. Showed using Stokes' theorem (7.3) that tangential wind falls off as 1/distance from an isolated circular patch of vorticity. |
| 5 |Cover the assigned **reading through 7.2.6**, & review **students answers to 7.5 a-k**. Collect (midnight) **HW1 ASSIGNMENT: Show (7.2) for a circular area using (7.4), and do problems 7.6-7.10**. Hand out draft sketch for Unit 1 exam. | Vorticity. Cover the assigned **reading: section 7.2.9.** & review **students' prepared, time-stamped questions (1 per student)** on vorticity films [(parts 1&2) here](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html). Assign vortex-interactions lab (IDV views captured in .ipynb). |
| 6 | ***Unit 1 in-class exam: vocabulary, math tools, kinematics*** | Decomposition of wind fields. Geostrophic/ageo, irrotational/divergent; the different kinds of ageostrophic flow |
| 7 | Discuss **graded work so far**. Then discuss assigned **reading: section 7.2.7 (thermal wind; i.e., all material through 7.2.9)**, and **any HW2 questions**; and **elicit student answers (or questions) to 7.5 l-z**  | Collect (midnight) **HW2: [Force-balanced wind](http://profhorn.meteor.wisc.edu/wxwise/kinematics/h5/balance.html) problems 7.19, 7.21, 7.22, 7.24, 7.42; Thermal wind problems 7.5m, 7.11, 7.25, 7.26** Consider project ideas. |
| 8 | [Consider project ideas: Wikipedia training](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/University_of_Miami/Weather_Analysis_(Fall_2019)?enroll=fjsbeacg). **Reading: through 7.3.5.** On that basis, **elicit student answers (or questions) to 7.5 l-z**  | Review (in class) **[Assigned IDV lab ppt.pdf](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/blob/master/Unit2-WHch7/2019_Warm-coolCore_Vortices_structurelab.pptx) in student forks, due by class time** |
|9|Rest of Ch. 7, Assemble Primitive Equations. Equation *set* properties: energy budget, role of heating in driving all flow. [What is a model?](http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/pimms/browser/CASCADE/ControlledVocabs/trunk/Software?rev=48&order=size) and [the MERRA(2) reanalysis](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/pubs/docs/Bosilovich785.pdf)? its [variables](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/documents/GEOS-5_Filespec_Glossary.pdf)? the [IAU](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-18-0117.1)?| **Examine [Assigned IDV lab ppt.pdf](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/blob/master/Unit2-WHch7/PV_budget_heatingrates_spinupconcept.pptx) responses in student forks, due by class time** | 
|10|Current wx (great front) & WH midlatitude storm (Ch 8). Assign final WH Ch7 problems.|**Read Ch9.1 and prepare for general verbal Q&A (study question 9.7)**|
|11|**HW due: WH 7.33-34, 7.35, 7.36, 7.38 & show that it can be expressed as vertical advection of either dry static energy or potential temperature in both z and p coordinates, 7.40 using 7.39, 7.43 & 7.45, 7.44.** Also include **a 1-paragraph project idea [(resources)](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/blob/master/README.md)**|**Do and upload** to Github the [LMT_3.2.ipynb Lab notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/blob/master/Notebooks/LackmannMapesTyle_3.2.ipynb) (in course Notebooks folder)| 
|12|Reading Ch.9 together. Make a hypothes.is account and install their Chrome plugin. Make annotations, and respond to one or more pre-existing annotation. How chaotic will this be with 11 of us? Let's find out. [My annotated Ch9](https://hyp.is/3ZI0DPmIEemNRccqX5PD3Q/cup.aos.wisc.edu/453/2016/readings/Atmospheric_Science-Wallace_Hobbs.pdf)|**HW due: WH exercises 9.8-9.11, 9.13-9.15, 9.17, 9.19, 9.24**|
